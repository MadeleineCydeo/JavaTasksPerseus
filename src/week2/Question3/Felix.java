           Numbers -- print consecutive numbers

            Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

            For example, here is the output for N = 24:
            1
            Codility
            Test
            Codility
            Coders
            CodilityTest
            7
            Codility
            Test
            Codi1ityCoders
            11
            CodilityTest
            13
            Codility
            TestCoders
            Codility
            17
            ....
